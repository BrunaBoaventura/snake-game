# Snake Game

Using OOP, the Snake Game, famously known from old Nokia phones, was recreated using the 
[turtle module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html)

## OOP
All main parts of the game were split into different files and subsequently classes.
This allows for the most readable final code and compartmentalisation of the logic.
